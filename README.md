# NERSA Project (哪吒工程)
> Neuromorphic Emulation and Reconstruction of Sensorimotor-function for Amputee


[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

## Description
"NERSA" is homophonic to a fictional deity named Nezha (哪吒) in Chinese folktale. The boy Nezha, once in critical condition after an excruciating tragedy, received a reconstructed body made from lotus roots. Thanks to the fibers and threads spanning through lotus roots, Nezha was able to re-gain his neural sensations and movements.


Project NERSA is inspired by Nezha. It aims at a similar goal: to re-enable the sensation and movement for amputee on a prosthetic hand.
